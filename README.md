# Segment Anything Medical Video
We I have developed a script capable of tracking, object detection, and segmentation in videos. By simply modifying the prompts, it can adapt to various applications, such as tracking surgical instruments. This script is based on the Tracking Anything with DEVA project and leverages advanced deep learning techniques to achieve efficient and accurate object tracking and segmentation.
